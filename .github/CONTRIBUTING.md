# Introduction

Any critical issues should be submitted directly in [contact](https://github.com/ArmynC/ArminC-AutoExec/blob/master/docs/README.md#support).

Make sure to use spaces (no tabs) and CRLF line endings for configs, and continue the Valve convention in the other file overrides. Ensure is no trailing space at the end of lines. Keep the max line before the needing of a scroll (in Fullscreen), otherwise, skip to a new line.

Command template:

```
// Description of the command.
// Default: value
//
// In-deep documented information about the command, recommended actions etc.
prefix_command "value"
```
